/**
 * Rare amino acid annotation:
 * 
 * These are amino acids that occurs very rarely in an organism. For instance, humans 
 * are supposed to use 20 amino acids, but there is also one rare AA. Selenocysteine, 
 * single letter code 'U', appears roughly 100 times in the whole genome. The amino 
 * acid is so rare that usually it does not appear in codon translation tables. It 
 * is encoded as UGA, which , under normal conditions, is a STOP codon. Secondary 
 * RNA structures are assumed to enable this special translation.

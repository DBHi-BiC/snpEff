19 October 1992		BLOSUM Matrices

	The file blosum.tar contains the 5.0 version of the BLOSUM series of
matrices. The BLOSUM matrices are based on the local alignments in version
5.0 of the Blocks database, and for Blosum62, for example, the sequences in
a block were clustered if they were at least 62% identical. We have
obtained improved results using the FASTA, BLASTP and SSEARCH programs
with BLOSUM matrices in the 60%-65% clustering range.
	For this work, please cite:
Steven Henikoff and Jorja G. Henikoff, "Amino acid substitution matrices
	from protein blocks", PNAS, in press.

	The file Blosum.sum includes a summary of the matrices.
For each matrix in the series, the following files are included:
	blosum*.out	Blosum output (includes raw frequencies)
        blosum*.qij	Target frequencies (odds ratios)
	blosum*.sij	Matrix in bit units, generic format 
        blosum*.iij	Matrix in variably scaled units, integer values
	blosum*.fas	blosum*.iij in FASTA/SSEARCH format
	blosum*.bla	blosum*.iij BLASTP format

The integer-valued matrices, blosum*.iij, include columns for B, Z and X
computed as weighted averages of columns N & D for B, of Q & E for Z, and of
all 20 amino acids for X. The scale is determined from the entropy H as:
    scale = min(1/2, 1/x) bits where x = round(2/sqrt(H)).

	Several programs are also included in the blosum.tar file. All
are written in standard C. They are:
	blosum		Make a blosum matrix from a Blocks database.
         (Creates the .out, .qij, .sij & .iij files)
	matrix		Compare two matrices.
	matblas		Convert a matrix to blastp format.
         (Creates the .bla files)
	matfas		Convert a matrix to fasta format.
         (Creates the .fas files)
	matalin		Convert a matrix to multalin format.
	matspace	Convert a matrix to spacer format.
To compile the programs, edit the Makefile if necessary, it is set up
for BSD UNIX. Then type "make blosums". Executable files are included
for SUN 4 systems.

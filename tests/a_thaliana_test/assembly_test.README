	Pablo - the attached may be of use.  It's my early test dataset.  Essentially just a number of overlapping 'reads' (actually just 
	a fragmented DNA sequence) that when assembled should blast exactly against the first 5 kbase 
	of the A Thaliana genome.

Files:
	- assembly_test.fa : Fake reads from A.Thaliana
	- assembly_test.result : First 5K bases from A.Thaliana chr1

Notes:

Transcript.java:
As its name implies,represents a transcript. HGVS nomenclature should be written for a variant with respect to the transcript.
In this class, we have access to introns,exons and their sequnces.

CodonChange:
Calculate: Calculate codon change for a given seqchange

CodonChange.Factory:
Called by Calculate to create a codon change object for a seqChange which calls different methods based on 
seqChange.changeType (Snp,Ins,Del,Mnp).

CodonChangeSNP class extends CodonChange.

CodonChange.codonChange:
It is the method that actually calculates codon changes for current CodonChange object.
In this method, line 128,129 of CodonChange.Java, it returns the codonNum and:

codonNum = (firstCdsBaseInExon + cdsBaseInExon) / CODON_SIZE;

so firstCdsBaseInExon + cdsBaseInExon is actually the nucleotide position with respect to the coding segment of the transcript (this is 0 based, plz note for HGVS it should be reported as 1 based)

--
Transcript gets codonChanges by Codon in
    public List<ChangeEffect> seqChangeEffect(SeqChange seqChange, ChangeEffect changeEffect) {
    ...
        changeEffectList.addAll(codonChange.calculate());
    }
